JRPlot, a simple graph plotting tool.

HELP:

To plot the graph of a function, just follow these steps:
1) Type the function expression on the "f(x)=" box.
2) Choose the interval of "x" values to which the function will be applied.
3) Click the "OK" butotn.


*** Function syntax: ***

Just use the regular expression syntax, such as:
---> x
---> 2*PI*x
---> (x^2.5)+1
---> sin(x)/3
---> exp( cos(x^2 + 1) )

Note that:

1) The expressions are made of:
- Value tokens, such as numbers and math constants (PI and E)
- Operators: +  -  *  /  ^
- Functions, for example: sin(a) , min(a,b) . A complete list of supported
functions is given below.
- Parenthesis for grouping and function aplying.

2) Whitespaces are ignored.

3) Implicit multiplication is supported. For example:
---> "2x" is the same as "2 * x".
---> 3(x^2 + 1) is the same as "3 * (x^2 + 1)".
---> xsin(PI) is not valid, because the "xsin" would be read as a single token. 


*** Supported math functions *** 

(case insensitive)

ABS(a)
ACOS(a)
ASIN(a)
ATAN(a)
COS(a)
EXP(a)
LOG(a)
LOGTEN(a)
MIN(a, b)
MAX(a, b)
SIN(a)
SQRT(a)
TAN(a)
